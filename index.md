### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
##### The first week of bootcamp exceeded my expectations in both workload and excitement. We dove right in to an ocean of material! 
### What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
##### I am excited to learn more about back end development, as it is honestly the part of web development that is a bit scary to me. 
### What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
##### I would say that I am much nerdier than I may appear, and it often surprises people. I'm a big fan of things like:
*   Video games (Play Station, Nintendo Switch, XBox, etc.)
*   Anime (I'm up to date on One Piece, and I like shonen shows, but also love a nice slice-of-life show).
*   Novels (I recommend *The Poppy Wars*, the *Red Rising* series, and also classical works like The Odyssey).
*   DnD (I've even been a DM, ✨dungeon master✨, for a few campaigns).

#### Most of all, I love traveling and experiencing new cultures (and learning their languages). 

### Please enjoy a few pictures from the two countries I visited last year in 2023, Scotland and Japan:
